# PRODIGY_GA_02
AI Image Generation Web App
This project is a web-based application that allows users to generate images from text prompts using a Generative AI model. Built as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech, it showcases skills in frontend development and API integration.

Features
üé® Generate images based on text prompts using Hugging Face AI models.
üöÄ Responsive and user-friendly interface.
‚è≥ Real-time loading indicator during image generation.
üñº Displays dynamically generated images.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend API: Hugging Face AI Model Integration
Hosting Environment: Local server (Python -m http.server)

How It Works
Enter a descriptive text prompt in the input field.
Click the Generate button.
The app sends the prompt to the Hugging Face API and fetches a generated image.
A loading indicator is displayed until the image is ready.
The generated image is displayed in the UI.
